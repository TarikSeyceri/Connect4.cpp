# Connect4.cpp
(Connect4 or 4Win) This project is a game developed in three versions, C, C++ &amp; Java SE, older to newer respect

This version is written in C++ Programming Language (MS Console) in 2012,

it was for my third semester project in uni

i was a beginner so please don't judge my programming standards.

i published it to give any freshman programmer a dose of encouragement, self-trust & programming help to write a game.

i used Dev-C++ IDE for Windows
